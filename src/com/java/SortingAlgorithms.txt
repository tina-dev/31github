1. Bubble Sort
The bubble sort algorithm’s average/worst time complexity is O(n²), as we have to pass through the array as many times as there are pairs in a provided array. Therefore, when time is a factor, there may be better options.

2. Insertion Sort
†he worst-case (and average-case) complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(n²)

3. Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm is made up of two nested loops. It has an O (n2) time complexity due to the two nested loops.
